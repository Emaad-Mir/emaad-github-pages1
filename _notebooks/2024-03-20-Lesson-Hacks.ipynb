    "(a) Explain the concept of iteration over a 2D array in Java. Provide an example scenario where iterating over a 2D array is useful in a programming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration over a 2D array in Java involves going through through the array row by row or column by column to access each element. Since a 2D array is an array of arrays, there are usually two nested loops: the outer loop iterates over the rows (or the first dimension), and the inner loop iterates over the columns (or the second dimension) of each row. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example where iterating over a 2D array is useful is in a game development setting, especially with grid-based games (ex. chess, tic-tac-toe, or minesweeper). Here, the rows and columns correspond to the board's grid, and each element stores information about that cell (like whether or not there is a mine in minesweeper or whether a cell is empty, contains an 'X', or an 'O' in tic-tac-toe). Iterating over a 2D array in games like these allows us to check the state of the game, update the board, or calculate scores based on the position of pieces or marks.\n",
