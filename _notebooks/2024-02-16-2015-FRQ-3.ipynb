    "This question was by far the most challenging for me to do out of the four, as while I was able to complete it, it took me some time before I began to understand what exactly Sparse arrays were. I found myself having to reread the question a few times in order to comprehend what it was asking me to do. If this happened to me on the actual AP Exam, I would end up losing some valuable time that could have been spent either trying to note down what information the question is giving me or even just complete another FRQ that I know how to answer better. Having completed the question, I definitely have a much better understanding of it now than I did before I saw this. Part A essentially asked to create a method that returned the value of an entry at a specific row and column. If there was an entry for that row and column, then the program would successfully display that value. If there was no entry for that row and column, then the program would just return 0 indicating that there is no entry there. This question centered a lot on 2D arrays, making it that kind of FRQ, although in the runtime version of my response, there were also a few elements of ArrayLists that I had to use as well. Overall, I now know that 2D arrays is something that I will need to heavily review to ensure that I don't get frozen on a question like this on the real AP Test should I get one as involved as this.
