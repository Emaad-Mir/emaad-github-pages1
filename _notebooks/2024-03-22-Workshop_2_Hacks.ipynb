    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "One one hand, an attribute or method declared as public in a POJO means that it can be accessed from any other class in the application. This allows other parts of the program to interact with the public fields or methods and the internal state of the object to be modified from anywhere. On the other hand, declaring an attribute or method as private restricts access to it from outside the class in which it is declared, so only the methods within the same class can directly access and modify these fields. This ensures that the internal state of an object is protected and can only be changed through controlled methods (getters and setters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If I wanted to make a system that handles sensitive information, such as a person's banking info, I would use private access modifiers for the fields that store the user's account number, balance, and personal details. I would choose private access controllers so that these details can't be directly accessed or modified from outside the class, protecting the data from unauthorized access and enhancing data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would really only use public access modifiers for something that does not really deal with sensitive information and is intended to be easily accessible from anywhere in the application without affecting the application's state, such as certain mathematical constants (like pi or e) or utility conversion methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n",
