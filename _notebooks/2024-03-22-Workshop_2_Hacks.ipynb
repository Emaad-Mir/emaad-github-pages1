    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Access Modifier: When an attribute or method is declared as public in a POJO (Plain Old Java Object), it means that it can be accessed from any other class in the application. This makes it easy for other parts of your program to interact with the public fields or methods, but it also means that the internal state of the object can be modified from anywhere, potentially leading to issues with data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Access Modifier: Declaring an attribute or method as private restricts access to it from outside the class in which it is declared. This means that only the methods within the same class can directly access and modify these fields. This encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, ensuring that the internal state of an object is protected and can only be changed through controlled methods (getters and setters). It enhances security and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Private: Suppose you are designing a system that handles sensitive information, such as a user's banking information. You would use private access modifiers for the fields that store the user's account number, balance, and personal details. This ensures that these details can't be directly accessed or modified from outside the class, enforcing encapsulation and protecting the data from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Public: For a class that defines constants or utility methods that are meant to be easily accessible from anywhere in the application without affecting the application's state, such as mathematical constants (PI, E) or utility conversion methods, public access modifiers would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n",

    "(a) Explain how a constructor works, including when it runs and what generally is done within a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an instance (object) of a class is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type, not even void. Constructors are used to initialize the object's properties with given or default values at the time of object creation. It runs automatically at the time of object instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a constructor, you can perform operations necessary to prepare an object for use, such as initializing instance variables, setting up initial states, or calling methods to set up the object. Constructors can be overloaded, allowing for different ways of initializing objects depending on the arguments passed when the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Create an example of an overloaded constructor within a class. You must use at least three variables. Include the correct initialization of variables and correct headers for the constructor. Then, run the constructor at least twice with different variables and demonstrate that these two objects called different constructors. \n"

Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a subtype relationship between classes.\n",

    "An example scenario where inheritance is useful is in a graphic user interface (GUI) framework where different types of UI elements (buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns) share common properties (like position, size, visibility) and behaviors (like render, hide, show). By using inheritance, these common features can be defined in a base class (e.g., UIElement), and each specific UI element class can inherit from it, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.\n",
