The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class.  Thus, it creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor.  Also, this Class contains a getter method called getHello() which returns the value with the \"String hello\".\n",

Also, observe the driver/tester now contains two objects that are initialized differently, 0 and 1 argument constructor.  Look at the usage of the \"this\" prefix.  The \"this\" keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable.\n",
