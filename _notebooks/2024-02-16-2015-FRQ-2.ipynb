    "\n",
    "Looking through all of question 2, this was definitely a Classes type question, as the whole question was based on being able to write the code for the entire HiddenWord class based on the information and rules that College Board gave for the guessing game. For the most part, completing this FRQ was not very difficult; however, the only thing that I was stunned on while completing this question was thinking about what the code would look like for if the user guessed a correct letter but it was in the wrong position. That was when I realized I could use != -1 because of the fact that -1 would indicate that the letter was not in the word at all. By writing != -1, that indicates that the letter the user guessed is an index in the word for the user to guess, but it is just in the wrong position. Overall, I also didn't have too terrible of a time completing this FRQ, although I do think that it is important that I review concepts like these further as we approach the AP exam. "
