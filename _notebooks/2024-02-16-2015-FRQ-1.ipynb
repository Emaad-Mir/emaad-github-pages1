    "Looking through all three parts of question 1, this was definitely an Array/ArrayLists type question, as all three parts required iterating through both one and two dimensional arrays as well as finding their sums. I generally find questions like these to be the easiest type (and I also enjoy working with arrays and arraylists the most), so I didn't have a very difficult time answering these questions. Comparing my solution (no runtime) to Collegeboard's key, I essentially did the same thing that they did with the exception of naming a few variables differently. While I do not find questions like these very difficult, it is important that I continue to review these, as we are now less than 3 months away from the exam. As we finish up trimester 2 and head into trimester 3, I will make sure to do more FRQs like these in my own time rather than solely study for the exam whenever Mr. Mortensen gives us some to do in class, as that will expand my knowledge beyond to just FRQs for a specific year.
