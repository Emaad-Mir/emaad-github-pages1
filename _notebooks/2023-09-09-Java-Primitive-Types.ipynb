    "# Overview of this Blog\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, this week we were introduced to some of Java's basic types, which can be broken down into primitive types (int, boolean, double, etc.) and non primitive types (strings). As someone who has had coding experience, especially in Java, for several years, none of the information presented was particularly new to me; however, I do think that it is important to make sure that I fully understand these types, as that will be one of the major parts of the exam in May, especially with the FRQs. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this blog does include the suggested hacks for this week, I decided to add in a couple more of my personal coding projects for fun, as I generally enjoy coding whenever I have free time. The first couple of cells are the suggested hacks, which are to make a class that demonstrates the use of the primitive and non primitive types in Java and to demonstrate inputs and outputs (multiple). In addition to those, I added a few cells that included my own Java projects, such as a reversed string algorithm and many others that you will see. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope that if anybody happens to see this blog that it will serve as a useful study tool as we begin preparing and reviewing for the exam in May!"

    "# Important Differences to Note about Widening and Narrowing Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "For both the widening and narrowing process, we convert one data type to another (as seen in both code cells). However, the one thing that separates the two is the fact that widening (going from a smaller type to a larger type size) can be done automatically while narrowing (going from a larger type to a smaller type size) has to be done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, whenever we perform casting on a certain variable with a certain data type (ex. int), if we want to convert it to, say, a long, all we have to do is set the previously defined variable equivalent to a new declared variable that is now a long. This is shown in the first code cell, where I was able to convert myLuckyInt, which was set to 19 (integer), into a long called myLuckyLong (still 19) without having to explicitly add (long) next to the myLuckyInt. And if I would like to go any further in converting my long into a larger types such as a float or double, I can follow the exact same process (before getting 19.0 at the very end).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in the second code cell where narrowing takes place, when I wanted to convert the double mySalary into a float, I had to perform one more step. Like usual, I defined the double mySalary (and added the d at the end to indicate that it is a double). Then, I made a new float called myFloatSalary, but instead of just being able to convert mySalary into an float  automatically, I had to add (float) in front of mySalary to indicate that I am converting the value into an integer. As a result the double version of salary will print out 213876.1592, while the float version of salary will only print out 213876.16. I would continue this process (like I did above) until I reached a much smaller data type such as a byte or a short, also making sure to add the data type in parenthesis where appropriate. \n",
