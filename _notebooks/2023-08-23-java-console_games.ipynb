The for loop indicates that all of the code within the loop will be ran until the user uses all three of their guesses and does not get it correct or until the user gets it correct in three guesses or less. If the user's guess is equivalent to randomG, the program will print out the \"You win!\" message and will break (exit) the loop. If the user's guess is greater than randomG, then the user will prompted with the \"The number is lower\" message. And of course, if the user's guess is less than randomG, then the user will be prompted with the \"The number is higher\" message. If a user guesses wrong but still has at least one more guess remaining, the user will be allowed to guess again (guess = scHL.nextInt()).

    "# Answers to Questions About Reorganization and AP Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that reorganization is important because by simplifying and reorganizing the code, we can get a better idea of what each individual game looks like when they are ran in their own cells rather than being chosen from a menu as shown in the first code cell. Also, simplifying the code makes it much easier to read, allowing us to follow along with what the logic is doing much better. Simplifying the code can also make it easier for us to identify any errors, as if we write an unnecessarily enormous amount of code and run into any problems, it can be much more difficult to find where the problem is as we have to scroll through many lines of code, most of which are duplicated. On the topic of duplicate code, simplifying and reorganizing the code can reduce the redundancy of the code, as if we just repeat the same lines of code multiple times when it could be replaced with something much simpler, it is a poor example of programming in Java. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think that AP Identification is important because it will play a big role in getting us ready for the AP exam in May. If we can identify the different units of the class that a program uses, we will be able to understand the code much better and thus have a greater ability to read other people's code, which is what the multiple choice section of the exam is mainly comprised of. Also, understanding what is an example of a primitive type or recursion will help us in implementing the units for the class in our own code, which will be key to doing well on the FRQ portion of the exam (4 Qs). \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, reorganization and AP Identification are both useful methods to help us improve our own code in general and improve our ability to read other peoples' code, both of which will be essential to doing well in this class and on the AP Exam. "
