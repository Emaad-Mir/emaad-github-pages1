    "Generally speaking, the Methods and Control Structures FRQ involve having to write the code for a certain method that College Board provides you with for a specified purpose. For example, with the FRQ I just did, in part a, I had to create a method for getScore, which returned the score of the user. If the game that the user played was a bonus round, their total score would be multiplied by 3. For part b, I had to write the code for the playManyTimes method, which returned the highest score of the games played if the play() method was called more than once."
