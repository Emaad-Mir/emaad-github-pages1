Hello! My name is Emaad Mir and I am a junior at Del Norte High School! I am very passionate in the field of AI and Machine Learning as well as the branch of cognitive science (psychology, neuroscience, etc.). I am very excited to be taking AP CSA this year and am eager to learn concepts that I either have never heard before or need a refresher on. 

Also take a look at this masterpiece:
