# Week 9 Objectives

- To play around and experiment with the different types in Java
- These types include...
    - Primitive Types
        - Int - represents signed 32-bit integer value
        - Double - represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point value
        - Boolean - represents true or false values
        - Long - represents a signed 64-bit integer value
        - Short - represents a signed 16-bit value
        - Float - represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point value
        - Char - represents a single Unicode character
    - Non-primitive Types
        - Strings

- To create a GUI menu for CSA FRQs
- To decide the topic we will be teaching this tri (our plan is Boolean and If Statements, and if that's already taken we will teach Writing Classes)




# Week 9 Hacks

- Create/define a class in Java that demonstrates the use of primitive types, such as int, double, and boolean, as well as non primitive data types such as strings
- Become familiar with reference data types in Java, such as strings, arrays, and classes
- Become familiar with hybrid data types in Java, such as wrapper classes and enums
- Include comments that talk about how each data type choice is appropriate to the application 
- Include a cell with casting
