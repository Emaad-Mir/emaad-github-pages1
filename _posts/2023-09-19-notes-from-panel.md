# Key Takeaways/Reflection on the Event


After attending the alumni panel, my interests in computer science and AI and machine learning in general went even deeper, as I watched many former CSP and CSA students speak about their experiences and thought about how they were once in the same place as I as. They all emphasized the importance of keeping a positive mindset, noting that setbacks and making mistakes should be expected for CSP, CSA, and even beyond. My experience in CSP definitely supports this idea, as I can remember making so many mistakes and becoming frustrated a lot of time before later on rising up and resolving an issues, whether it was individually or as a group. The alumni also discussed how Google and the Internet in general can often be our best friend for things as small as syntax errors. One thing that especially stood out to me was to focus on my own journey and not getting carried away by the pace or direction of others'. I also really liked how they brought up engaging in personal projects and participating in clubs outside of school that can positively impact the community, as that can make for a well-structured resume for job applications and internships. It was also really insightful to hear from one of the panelists about how his first year at UCI as a CS major was a breeze, which really goes to show how useful the skills you learn in CSP and CSA are. Overall, from attending the alumni panel, I learned that having a genuine passion and dedication for your work is crucial in ensuring that your career in CS or anything you want to pursue will be successful. After hearing these former students speak about their experiences then and talk about where they are now, I'm more than inspired to change my overall attitude toward CSA and computer science as a whole.
